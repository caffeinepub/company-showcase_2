# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Change the hero section descriptive paragraph text color to dark gray (light black).

**Planned changes:**
- Apply `text-gray-600` (dark gray) Tailwind class to the descriptive paragraph text in the Hero component (`frontend/src/components/Hero.tsx`)

**User-visible outcome:** The descriptive paragraph in the Hero section renders in a softer dark gray color instead of full black or white, improving visual appearance while remaining clearly readable.
