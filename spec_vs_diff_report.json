  "summary": "The diff shows that Hero.tsx was modified to apply text-gray-600 to the descriptive paragraph text, which directly implements REQ-51. The file summary confirms the descriptive paragraph now uses text-gray-600 (light black/dark gray) for improved readability. The actual code shows the class applied to the heroContent variable which uses defaultContent as fallback. All acceptance criteria appear to be met.",
